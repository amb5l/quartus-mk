# quartus-mk

Simple support for driving Intel Quartus from makefiles.

To get started:
1. Add quartus-mk to your repo as a submodule.
2. Copy the template makefile to your build directory and edit it to add your sources etc.

The build process creates a Quartus project that you can open in the IDE.
